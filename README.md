# hospital_mgmt_system
A patient and user tracking system for a theoretical hospital.
My name is Erik Smistad, I'm currently a student at Mount Royal in the Bachelor of Computer Information Systems program. This program is probably my crowning achievement so far. 

Please note that the ConsoleInteraction and Menu classes were built by my teacher at the time, Jordan Kidney and they are used with his permission.
